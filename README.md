# Wine_Classification

Hi, this is a wine classification dataset and we had various ML algorithms to check the accuary of classification. First we preprocessed the data and applied ML Algorithms where we found that the GaussianNB algorithm has the higghest accuracy of classifying and the MultinomialNB having the least accuracy of classification.
